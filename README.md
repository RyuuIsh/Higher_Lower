# Higher_Lower
A fun, interactive Python game where players guess which celebrity, influencer, or public figure has more followers on social media. Inspired by the popular "Higher or Lower" concept, this game challenges your knowledge of global popularity!

## Features
- Randomized Gameplay:
 - Each round features two randomly selected accounts from a dataset.
- Account Descriptions:
 - Provides details about each account, including name, description, and country.
- Follower Comparison:
 - Players guess which account has more followers.
- Score Tracking:
 - Keeps track of your streak, increasing your score for every correct answer.
- Replayability:
 - Continues until the player guesses incorrectly, displaying the final score.

## How it works
1. Start the Game:
- Two accounts are displayed, including their name, description, and country.
2. Make Your Guess:
- Decide which account has more followers and type 'A' or 'B'.
3. Check the Answer:
- The game reveals whether your guess was correct or not.
- If correct, your score increases, and the game continues with a new account.
- If wrong, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- replit package for clearing the console (or equivalent alternatives for local execution).

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed account data for richer gameplay.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience.
- Include categories or themes for the accounts (e.g., sports, music, actors).
- Introduce leaderboards to track top scores.
